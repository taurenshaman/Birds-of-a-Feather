# original docs

I was inspired by [these designs](https://nytrami.design/graphic-design/classic-british-bird-illustrations/) and worked to make a generative version that would create unique, random birds.

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
